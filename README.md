Simple demo: https://ygds.herokuapp.com/

Yggdrasill is (or rather, hopefully will be) the server of an opensource MMORPG.

I'm taking [Ragnarok Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online) as inspiration.

The aim is to build a game capable to some degree of:

* Combat
  * PC vs NPC (PVE)
  * NPC vs NPC (EVE)
  * PC vs PC (PVP)
* Social
  * Friends list
  * Groups
  * Guilds
* Progression
  * Classless leveling
    * The more you use/do something, the better you get
  * Weapon/Armor proficiency/Level
    * The more you use a weapon/weapon class, the better you get
* Maps
  * One instance per map, many portal separated maps (Ragnarok online maps)
* NPCs
  * Agent based NPCs with schedules, itineraries etc...
  * Simulate farming basic resources, and making items.
* Economy
  * Open market
  * PCs and NPCs buys and sells from market with buy/sell orders or one on one negotiations
  * Every item can be manufactured by PCs/NPCs
  * NPC controlled auctions (PCs can sell items in auctions and both PCs and NPCs can buy)
* Extra
  * Persistent PC presence (Needs more thinking...)
    * When a player logout the PC stays in the game and assumes an agent based AI (configurated by the player)
